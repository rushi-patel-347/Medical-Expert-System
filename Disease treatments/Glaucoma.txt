You may not notice the symptoms at first since they might appear gradually. A thorough dilated eye exam is the only method to determine if you have glaucoma.

Although there is no known cure for glaucoma, early detection and treatment can frequently reverse visual loss.

Treatments for Glaucoma include:

Oral Medicines:

You could also be given oral medications by your doctor, such as beta blockers or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. 
These medications can facilitate fluid drainage or inhibit fluid production in your eye.

Eye drops:
These either accelerate the fluid's passage out of your eye or reduce its production, decreasing ocular pressure. Allergies, redness, stinging, impaired vision, and itchy eyes are examples of side effects.

Laser surgery:

Fluid drainage from the eye is aided by laser surgery. This action may at any moment be advised by your doctor. Following the operation, medications are frequently still need to be taken.

When glaucoma affects both eyes, treatment often only involves one eye at a time. Each eye will have a laser treatment at least a few days to a few weeks apart.
