For ill patients, babesiosis usually is treated for at least 7-10 days with a combination of two prescription medications

Prevention:
Walk on cleared trails and stay in the center of the trail, to minimize contact with leaf litter, 
brush, and overgrown grasses, where ticks are most likely to be found.

Minimize the amount of exposed skin, by wearing socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt.

Apply repellents to skin and clothing

Medications:

Atovaquone + azithromycin
Clindamycin + quinine

Risk factors for severe babesiosis include asplenia, advanced age, and other causes of impaired immune function (e.g., HIV, malignancy, corticosteroid therapy)

Some immunosuppressive therapies or conditions may affect the clinical manifestations (e.g., the patient might be afebrile)

Severe cases can be associated with marked thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic instability, acute respiratory distress, myocardial infarction, renal failure, hepatic compromise, altered mental status, and death
