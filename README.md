Introduction
<br/>
Expert system shells are used in the creation of expert systems. These shells are empty Expert System knowledge bases with the structure and interface already built for us; all we need to do is populate the KB with knowledge. Instead of building an Expert System from scratch, we will design and construct an expert system utilizing a tiny Expert System shell for this task. We built the concerned expert system using the Experta Framework.
