A condition of having a lower body temperature than normal body temperature.
It causes excessive shivering, slowed breathing, mumbled speech, confusion, drowsiness and weak pulse.
Normal body temperature is around 98.6 F (37 C). Hypothermia (hi-poe-THUR-me-uh) occurs as your body temperature falls below 95 F (35 C).
When your body temperature drops, your heart, nervous system and other organs can't work normally. Left untreated, hypothermia can eventually lead to complete failure of your heart and respiratory system and eventually to death.

The causes include:
Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold.
The most common causes are cold water and cold weather

This exposure to cold can be caused by:
Not wearing clothes that are warm enough
Staying in the cold for too long
Falling into cold water by accident

Risk factors that increase the chances of getting hypothermia include:
Age – the elderly and children are more likely to get hypothermic
Alcohol – causes vasodilatation and heat loss
Medications – antidepressants, antipsychotics affect the body’s ability to regulate temperatures
Overexertion - the tolerance for cold diminishes when one is tired
Diabetes
Thyroid conditions
Severe trauma

Diagnosis:
The diagnosis of hypothermia is generally obvious based on a person's physical indications and the circumstances under which the individual became unwell or was discovered. Blood testing can also assist establish the presence and severity of hypothermia.
However, a diagnosis may be difficult to make if the symptoms are modest, such as when an elderly person indoors has confusion, loss of coordination, and speech difficulties.
