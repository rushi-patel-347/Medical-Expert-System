A chest infection is an infection that affects your lungs, either in the larger airways (bronchitis) or in the smaller air sacs (pneumonia). 

There is a build-up of pus and fluid (mucus), and the airways become swollen, making it difficult for you to breathe. 

Chest infections can affect people of all ages

Causes:

the main types of chest infection are bronchitis and pneumonia. 
Most bronchitis cases are caused by viruses, whereas most pneumonia cases are due to bacteria. These infections are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes

A chesty cough â€“ you may cough up green or yellow mucus.
Wheezing and shortness of breath.
Chest pain or discomfort.
A high temperature.
A headache.
Aching muscles.
