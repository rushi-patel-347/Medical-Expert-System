Diabetes is a long-term (chronic) illness that affects how your body converts food into energy or it can be said that a disease in which your body either can't produce insulin or can't properly use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas..

The majority of the food you consume is converted by your body into sugar (glucose), which is then released into your circulation.

There are two types of diabetes:

1.Type 1 diabetes 

Type 1 diabetes, often known as insulin-dependent diabetes, is an autoimmune disorder in which the body can not manufacture insulin. Type 1 diabetes accounts for around 10% of all cases.

2. Type 2 diabetes

In Type 2 Diabetes, people's bodies are unable to create enough insulin or are unable to utilise the insulin they do make efficiently. Type 2 diabetes affects around 90% of patients with diabetes.

People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years.
