An infection of the blood stream resulting in a cluster of symptoms such as drop in a blood pressure, increase in heart rate and fever.

Sepsis is the bodyâ€™s extreme response to an infection. It is a life-threatening medical emergency.
Sepsis happens when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout your body.  Infections that lead to sepsis most often start in the lung, urinary tract, skin, or gastrointestinal tract. 
Without timely treatment, sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.

Symptoms:
Generalized body swelling
Faster heart rate
Reduced urine output
Fever and chills
Decrease in platelet count
Difficulty in breathing
Mental confusion
Hyperventilation

Causes:
The cause of sepsis is bacterial, viral or fungal infection.
The risk factors include:
Weak immune system
Having diabetes or cirrhosis
Wounds or injuries such as burns

Complications:
If left untreated or if treatment is delayed, then it will lead to severe complications:
Reduced blood flow to organs such as brain, heart and kidney.
Reduced flow in arteries results in blood clot.
Blood clot may lead to gangrene, requiring amputation of affected limb, toes or finger.
Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
