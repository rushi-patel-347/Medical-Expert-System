Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's germ-fighting network. 

The lymphatic system includes the lymph nodes (lymph glands), spleen, thymus gland and bone 
marrow. 

Lymphoma can affect all those areas as well as other organs throughout the body.

Causes:

Doctors aren't sure what causes lymphoma. But it begins when a disease-fighting white blood cell called a lymphocyte develops a genetic mutation. The mutation tells the cell to multiply rapidly, causing many diseased lymphocytes that continue multiplying

Symptoms:

Painless swelling of lymph nodes in your neck, armpits or groin.
Persistent fatigue.
Fever.
Night sweats.
Shortness of breath.
Unexplained weight loss.
Itchy skin
