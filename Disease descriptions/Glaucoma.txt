Glaucoma is a frequent eye ailment caused by damage to the optic nerve, which links the eye to the brain.

Although it may affect anybody, adults in their 70s and 80s are the most frequently affected.

Glaucoma is the result of damage to the optic nerve. As it is often brought on by fluid accumulation in the front of the eye, which raises intraocular pressure.

This nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye.

The fluid that circulates around your eye, called aqueous humour, builds up and causes elevated eye pressure.

This fluid often drains through tissue (trabecular meshwork) at the angle where the iris and cornea meet and enters the front of the eye (anterior chamber).

Pressure rises up when liquids can't drain at a regular pace because of overproduction or a malfunctioning drainage system.

Glaucoma can cause vision loss if it is not identified and treated at an early stage.

Types of glaucoma are:

Primary open-angle glaucoma
Angle-closure glaucoma

Dignosis:

The following are checked for diagnosing Glaucoma:

Pressure in eyes
Nausea and vomiting
Drainage angle of eyes
Examination of optic nerve for damage
Testing of peripheral side vision
Measurement of optic nerve
thickness of cornea
