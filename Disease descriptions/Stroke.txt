A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. 

In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. 

A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death

Types of Strokes:

Ischemic stroke:

occurs when a blood clot blocks or narrows an artery leading to the brain. 
A blood clot often forms in arteries damaged by the buildup of plaques (atherosclerosis). 
It can occur in the carotid artery of the neck as well as other arteries. 
This is the most common type of stroke.

Hemorrhagic stroke:

Occurs when blood from an artery suddenly begins bleeding into the brain. 
As a result, the part of the body controlled by the damaged area of the brain cannot work properly. 

Symptoms:

Sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body. 
Sudden confusion
trouble speaking
difficulty understanding speech 
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
Sudden trouble walking
dizziness
loss of balance 
lack of coordination
