Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by germs that are spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. A person with TB can die if they do not get treatment.

Symptoms of active TB include:

1) A cough that lasts more than three weeks
2) Loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss
3) Fever
4) Chills
5) Night sweats

There are 3 stages of TBâ€”exposure, latent, and active disease. A TB skin test or a TB blood test can diagnose the disease. Treatment exactly as recommended is necessary to cure the disease and prevent its spread to other people.

There are two kinds of tests used to detect TB bacteria in the body: the TB skin test (TST) and TB blood tests.
