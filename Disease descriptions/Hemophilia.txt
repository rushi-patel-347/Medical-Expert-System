An inherited disorder in which the blood does not clot due to insufficient clotting factors. 
This causes unexplained bleeding, pain, swelling or tightness in joints, blood in urine or stool, and nose bleeds.


Symptoms include:
Blood in urine or stool
Joint pain and swelling
Unexplained, excessive or easy bleeding
Large and deep bruises
Frequent nosebleeds
Bleeding gums
Irritability (especially in children)
Bleeding after having shots, such as vaccinations.
Bleeding in the head of an infant after a difficult delivery.

The causes include:
Hemophilia is an inherited genetic condition, caused by a defect in the gene that determines how the body makes factors VIII, IX or XI
These genes are located on the X chromosome, making hemophilia a X-linked recessive disease
Hemophilia is caused by deficiency of clotting factors VII, IX or XI

Complications:
If untreated for a prolonged period it may lead to:
Deep internal bleeding
Damage to joints
Infection which might result from transfusion of contaminated blood products
Adverse reaction to clotting factor treatment due to negative immune reaction to the clotting factors used to treat bleeding
