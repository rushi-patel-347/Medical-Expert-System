Crabs are parasites. Crabs are often referred to as pubic lice and are not to be confused with body lice

The scientific name for crabs is Pediculus pubis. Crabs need blood to survive, but they can live up to 24 hours off a human body

Crabs have three very distinct phases; egg, nit (egg or young louse), and adult louse

The louse is the stage of the parasite that causes itching. Louse is the singular for lice (like mouse and mice)

Causes:

Sexual transmission - You can get crabs when you have skin-to-skin contact with another person. Even when there is no sexual penetration, you can get (or give) crabs.

Non-sexual transmission - You can get crabs from sleeping in an infested bed or using infested towels.
