Chikungunya is a rare viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.
It is characterized by a rash, fever, and severe joint pain (arthralgias) that usually lasts for three to seven days.

Chikungunya usually doesn't cause death, but the symptoms can be severe and debilitating. 
The most common symptoms are joint aches and pains. The disease can also cause:  
Symptoms:
fever
depression
fatigue
headache
muscle pain
rash
joint pain

Causes:
Two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, are carriers of the chikungunya virus. These mosquito types are most common in the southeastern United States and tend to bite people in the daytime. 
A mosquito can transmit the virus by biting a person. The virus then multiplies rapidly in the blood.
Mosquitoes also transmit viruses such as dengue and West Nile. 
The chikungunya virus is more likely to infect a person than other mosquito-transmitted viruses.
