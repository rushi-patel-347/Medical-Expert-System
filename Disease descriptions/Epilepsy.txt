Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness.

It is the fourth most common neurological disorder in the world.

Epilepsy may strike any person. Men and women of different ages, races, and cultural origins can develop epilepsy.

Various signs of seizures can occur. During a seizure, some epileptics just gaze blankly for a brief period of time, while others continously jerk their limbs or legs. 

One seizure may not always indicate epilepsy. A diagnosis of epilepsy typically requires at least two unexplained episodes.
