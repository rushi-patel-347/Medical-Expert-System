Jaundice is a condition in which the skin, whites of the eyes and mucous membranes turn yellow because of a high level of bilirubin, a yellow-orange bile pigment. Jaundice has many causes, including hepatitis, gallstones and tumors. In adults, jaundice usually doesn't need to be treated

Jaundice is often a sign of a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. Jaundice can occur when too much bilirubin builds up in the body. This may happen when: There are too many red blood cells dying or breaking down (hemolysis) and going to the liver.


Moderate levels lead to a yellow color, while very high levels will appear brown.
An inflamed liver or obstructed bile duct can lead to jaundice, as well as other underlying conditions.

Jaundice is often a sign of a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas. Jaundice can occur when too much bilirubin builds up in the body. This may happen when:

There are too many red blood cells dying or breaking down (hemolysis) and going to the liver.
The liver is overloaded or damaged.
The bilirubin from the liver is not able to properly move into the digestive tract.

Conditions that can cause jaundice include:

Infections of the liver from a virus (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and hepatitis E) or a parasite

Use of certain drugs (such as an overdose of acetaminophen) or reactions to other medicines or or exposure to poisons (for example, poisonous mushrooms)

Birth defects or disorders present since birth that makes it hard for the body to breakdown bilirubin (such as Gilbert syndrome, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, or Crigler-Najjar syndrome)

Chronic liver disease

Gallstones or gallbladder disorders causing blockage of the bile duct

Blood disorders

Cancer of the pancreas

Bile buildup in the gallbladder because of pressure in the belly area during pregnancy (jaundice of pregnancy)
